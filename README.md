## ðŸ”´ Demo
ðŸ§ª [Live Demo](https://yondagonda.github.io/ecommerce-store) available. Click "Live Demo" to open it.

## Motivations
I wanted to create this project as having just learnt Tailwind CSS and some of React's less used hooks such as useRef and useContext, It made sense to try and practice these new skills on a UI and logic heavy project. Furthermore, I wanted exposure to a project that would require a larger codebase compared to all my previous projects so that I could better prepare myself for future work in a professional setting.

## Showcase
Here are some showcase images of the project.

- **Wishlist**: Users can save games to their wishlist, making it easier to keep track of games they want to purchase or explore further.

## Performance
There were some issues with performance originally, unsurprsingly arising as a result of loading 30+ high quality images all at once in the 'browse' page.
After some research, I went to work on compressing the image sizes by converting them to the more effiect .webp format, and also by creating a minified version of the image that would be rendered as the thumbnail.

Below are some performance metrics as analysed by [Google Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk)

## Technologies 
- React Context API
- React Router 
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind CSS
- Git

## What I learnt:

- Framer motion and its complexities with animating components upon mount and unmount
- Furthered understanding of React Router through having to organise and connect my pages
- React Context API and hooks such as useRef
- How to more efficiently integrate a large number of images into a site without completely ruining performance

## Possible Features/Improvements to Implement:
- Implementing Stripe Demo Payments into the checkout process
- Using a CDN to further improve performance
